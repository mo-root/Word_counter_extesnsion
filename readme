## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Chrome Extension API

## How to use

1. Download and install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](link-to-webstore).
2. Browse to any website.
3. Highlight a paragraph of text.
4. The number of words in the highlighted text will be displayed in an alert box.

## How it works

The extension uses a content script that listens for a "mouseup" event on the document, which is fired when the user releases the mouse button after highlighting text. The content script then gets the selected text using `window.getSelection().toString()` and counts the number of words in the selected text using `split(/\s+/)` and counting the number of items in the resulting array.
